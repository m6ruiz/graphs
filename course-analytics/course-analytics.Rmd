# R/RStudio Fundamentals, on-demand ongoing offering

## Enrollment

1. Download entire enrollment CSV from [catalog analytics](https://cdph.catalog.instructure.com/new_analytics/listings)
2. Rename CSV file "enrollment_export.csv"
3. Move CSV file into course-analytics folder

TODO: cumulative enrollment over time


```{r import-data, include=FALSE}
enrollment_export <- read_csv("enrollments_export.csv")
```

```{r include=FALSE}
r_fund <- filter(enrollment_export, `Listing Name` == "R and RStudio Fundamentals")
```

**`r dim(r_fund)[1]`** total participants enrolled in R/RStudio Fundamentals as of `r Sys.Date()`

```{r include=FALSE}
one_week_ago <- today()-7
r_fund_week <- filter(r_fund, `Created At` > one_week_ago)
```

**`r dim(r_fund_week)[1]`** participants enrolled in R/RStudio Fundamentals since `r one_week_ago`

## Certificates

1. Go to [certifier.io](https://certifier.io/), go to "Credentials", select all, export
2. Rename CSV file "certificates.csv"
3. Move CSV file into course-analytics folder

```{r include=FALSE}
certificates <- read_csv("certificates.csv")
r_fund_certs <- filter(certificates, `Group name` == "R and R Studio Fundamentals")
r_fund_certs_week <- filter(r_fund_certs, `Issued on` > one_week_ago)
```

**`r dim(r_fund_certs)[1]`** received a certificate of completion for R/RStudio Fundamentals as of `r Sys.Date()` and **`r dim(r_fund_certs_week)[1]`** received it since `r one_week_ago`
